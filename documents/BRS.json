Currently, the system faces many challenges, including low recycling participation, inefficient collection routes that often result in missed pickups, and bins that frequently overflow due to infrequent service. Residents are frustrated with these ongoing issues, and the city relies heavily on manual reporting, driver accountability, and resident complaints to track and resolve problems. Monthly reports are still created manually, and the lack of real-time data makes it difficult to coordinate with drivers, track performance, or engage residents effectively. If these issues are not addressed, the city will continue to face rising costs, environmental concerns, and reduced public satisfaction with municipal services. To solve these problems, a Smart Waste Management and Recycling System (SWMRS) will be introduced. This system will provide real-time tracking of costs, fuel usage, and worker performance, while sensors in bins will alert drivers when they are full and GPS tracking will optimize truck routes and reduce delays. Additionally, a recycling rewards program and mobile app will encourage resident participation, allow users to report issues directly, and give city officials the ability to adjust routes and confirm pickups in real time. Implementing SWMRS will make waste management significantly more efficient, save the city money, improve driver productivity, and increase resident satisfaction. Ultimately, it will create a connected, data-driven waste management system that engages the community, reduces environmental impact, and builds a cleaner, more sustainable future for the city.</span></p>",
